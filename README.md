# MultiStage-Farmer-Problem-with-Scenario-Reduction and Nested Decomposition

A multistage format of Farmer Problem in "Introduction to Stochastic Programming" by Fran√ßois Louveaux and John R. Birge is optimized using GAMS.

Optimization is performed based on the Nested Decompostion algorithm.

Scenario Reduction is performed based on the paper entitled "Scenario Reduction Techniques in Stochastic Programming"

Scenario Reduction is coded in MATLAB

A multistage format of Farmer Problem with scenario reducstion is solved via GAMS
